# Complete the layout

Complete the following layout (designed by Bitmaker's Jesse Mykolyn) using the tools we've learned so far.

## Target layout

Here's what the site should look like once complete:

![Small Screen Layout](http://bitmakerhq.s3.amazonaws.com/lessons/front-end-development/resources/sm.png =x400 "Small screen")

![Medium Screen Layout](http://bitmakerhq.s3.amazonaws.com/lessons/front-end-development/resources/md.png =x400 "Medium screen")

![Large Screen Layout](http://bitmakerhq.s3.amazonaws.com/lessons/front-end-development/resources/lg.png =x400 "Large screen")


## Taking it further

Consider other ways to incorporate our learning into this application:

- A fancy custom menu button?
- Can we create a scroller?
- Hover over images to show a caption?
